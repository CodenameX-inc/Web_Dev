<br>Discover the web application and find your first flag hidden in the HTML source code
<br> To view the source code add<code>view-source:</code> before the URL to be like this <code>view-source:http://{IP}/index.php</code>
<br> Enter the flag (<code>ETSCTF_FLAG_IN_SOURCE</code>) to complete this step.",

<br>The parameter is <code>page</code> and used to pass a value to the web application code
<br>Actually this web application takes the value that passed by parameter <code>page</code> then put it in a function called <code>include</code>
<br>Include function used to include the content of the files, that's mean any value you will write it in this parameter then it will be included to the web application
<br>This vulnerability called Local File Inclusion, the attacker can exploit it by pass senstive files like /etc/passwd and semi files
<br>Enter the parameter name <code>page</code> to complete this step.",

<br>Now this time we want to include the php files and print it in the page like the previous step
<br>You can't view the PHP codes with <code>include</code> function because it executed the code
<br>Because of that we want to encode the content of the files by add <code>php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=</code> before the value
<br>Then it will be encoded by <code>Base64</code> you can decode the content execute this command in the terminal <code>echo 'encoded' | base64 -d</code>
