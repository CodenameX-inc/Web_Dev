Menu items allow you to add entries to the frontend menu.

These support full HTML mode so that you can add icons and
other details that may be needed by some special cases.

The two fields are:
* **Link name**: The name that will be displayed for the entry. (eg. `<i class="fab fa-discord text-discord"></i><p class="text-discord">Join our Discord!</p>`)
* **URL**: An optional url that we will link to for this entry (eg. `http://example.com/`)


**WARNING:** There is no validation performed to the fields. Be careful not to break the frontend HTML.
