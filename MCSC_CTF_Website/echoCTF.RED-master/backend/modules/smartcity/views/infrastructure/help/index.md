Create infrastructure elements that will be linked to the platform.

These elements can correspond to other systems, API's or diorama model
elements (such as a train station). With this we can create simulated
environments that provide external visual cues depending on the activity
of the players on the platform.

The fields are:
* `Name`: Infrastructure element name (eg Train Station or Discord WebHook)
* `Description`: A short description for this element
