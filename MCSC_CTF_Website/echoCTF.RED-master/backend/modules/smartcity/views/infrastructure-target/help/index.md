Target links to infrastructure elements.

This area links targets with infrastructure elements
(eg diorama controllable buildings) and helps in providing
visual cues related to them. This allows us for instance
to make the perimeter lights of a building change
colors when a specific target is under attack.

The fields are self explanatory:
* `Infrastructure ID`: The infrastructure element that we're linking (eg train station)
* `Target ID`: The target that will be linked to this element
