Manage per player disabled routes. These pages allow you to create well defined
deny lists so that the users cannot access specific operations on the frontend.

Fields:
* `Player ID`: The player that this rule will apply to
* `Route`: The internal route to be disabled

**NOTE**: Admin and Support players on the frontend, bypass this restriction.
